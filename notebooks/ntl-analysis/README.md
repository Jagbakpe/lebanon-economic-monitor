# Night Time Lights in Lebanon

Nighttime lights have become a commonly used resource to estimate changes in local economic activity. This section shows where nighttime lights are concentrated across Lebanon and observed changes over time.

## Data

We use nighttime lights data from the VIIRS Black Marble dataset. Raw nighttime lights data requires correction due to cloud cover and stray light, such as lunar light. The Black Marble dataset applies advanced algorithms to correct raw nighttime light values and calibrate data so that trends in lights over time can be meaningfully analyzed. From VIIRS Black Marble, we use monthly data from January 2012 through August 2022â€”where data is available at a 500-meter resolution.
